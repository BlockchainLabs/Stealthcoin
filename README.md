# Stealthcoin
PoS combined with Tor anonymity.  „Tor” and the „Onion Logo” are registered trademarks of The Tor Project, Inc.  We are aiming to make stealthcoin the primary private currency over the next six months. We believe this is possible for the following reasons: stealthcoin has a fair distribution Nearly four hours of low block rewards to prevent instamining. Tiny Premine There is only a small premine of 1% to fund future feature development. PREMINE LEDGER Energy efficient After a reasonable Proof-of-Work („PoW”) period, stealthcoin will switch to proof-of-stake („PoS”) to take advantage of the long-term energy efficiency of PoS mining. Which is considerably less wasteful than PoW while keep the network secure.
